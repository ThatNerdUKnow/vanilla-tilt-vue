## Installation

  

`npm i vanilla-tilt-vue`

  

  

## Usage

  

```js

Import Tilt from 'vanilla-tilt-vue'

```

And inside your template...

```html

<template>

<Tilt options="options(must be an object)">

<!-- Whatever elements you want to tilt -->

</Tilt>

</template>

```

The options prop must be a JavaScript object. The options available are identical to the ones required by vanilla-tilt

  

```js

{

reverse: false, // reverse the tilt direction

max: 35, // max tilt rotation (degrees)

startX: 0, // the starting tilt on the X axis, in degrees.

startY: 0, // the starting tilt on the Y axis, in degrees.

perspective: 1000, // Transform perspective, the lower the more extreme the tilt gets.

scale: 1, // 2 = 200%, 1.5 = 150%, etc..

speed: 300, // Speed of the enter/exit transition

transition: true, // Set a transition on enter/exit.

axis: null, // What axis should be disabled. Can be X or Y.

reset: true, // If the tilt effect has to be reset on exit.

easing: "cubic-bezier(.03,.98,.52,.99)", // Easing on enter/exit.

glare: false, // if it should have a "glare" effect

"max-glare": 1, // the maximum "glare" opacity (1 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%)

"glare-prerender": false, // false = VanillaTilt creates the glare elements for you, otherwise

// you need to add .js-tilt-glare>.js-tilt-glare-inner by yourself

"mouse-event-element": null, // css-selector or link to HTML-element what will be listen mouse events

// you need to add .js-tilt-glare>.js-tilt-glare-inner by yourself

gyroscope: true, // Boolean to enable/disable device orientation detection,

gyroscopeMinAngleX: -45, // This is the bottom limit of the device angle on X axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the left border of the element;

gyroscopeMaxAngleX: 45, // This is the top limit of the device angle on X axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the right border of the element;

gyroscopeMinAngleY: -45, // This is the bottom limit of the device angle on Y axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the top border of the element;

gyroscopeMaxAngleY: 45, // This is the top limit of the device angle on Y axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the bottom border of the element;

}

```
To enable the parallax effect simply use
```html
<Tilt parallax="true">
<div>
	Your content here
</div>
</Tilt>
```
And add the CSS property `transform: translateZ(20px)` to the element that you want to float.
